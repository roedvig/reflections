When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with others, when I want to publish work or for backup purposes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because files on github are “published” and you want to control what is published.
