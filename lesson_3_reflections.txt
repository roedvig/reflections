When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I want to collaborate with others, when I want to publish work or for backup purposes.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because files on github are “published” and you want to control what is published.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks is the same as clone, but only on githubs servers. clone is used for working locally and for downloading/syncing with github. Branches are the things that are cloned or forked.
